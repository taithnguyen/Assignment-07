## Design
The main purpose of this design was simplicity and creating a certain mood that would create the intended effect on the user. Since journaling should be a calming and positive activity done normally at night, shades of blue and purple were used. It should be noted that any and all unnecessary features are removed in order to create a simplified process as well as replicate the inspiration of a manual journal. Thus, the two focuses for the design were keeping only necessary features and having a pleasant color that would keep the user comfortable.
